# Loop Habit Tracker

Loop is a mobile app that helps you create and maintain good habits. While the original app was developed exclusively for Android, this branch contains a work-in-progress proof-of-concept multi-platform version of the app, which targets Android and iOS.  **The software in this branch is still in pre-alpha stage. Expect bugs, incomplete features and poor performance.** Suggestions and pull requests are very welcome.
